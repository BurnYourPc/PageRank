# PageRankImplementation

You can use our implementation in order to evaluate a list of web sites of your choice by running the naive Page Rank algorithm.

We use Python 3.5.2

Run PageRankImplementation.py

You can give your list as a txt file or you can choose to open an input-window. You can take a look at a txt-example in https://github.com/BurnYourPc/PageRankImplementation/blob/master/getRanking/sites.txt

Save your txt in path/to/BurnYourPc/PageRankImplementation/getRanking folder.

Our implementation parses all the web sites and constructs the corresponding directed graph. Each web site is a vertex and if web site A has an outbound link to web site B then there is a directed edge from vertex A to vertex B. Then the Page Rank algorithm is excecuted and a pdf with the ratings is generated in path/to/BurnYourPc/PageRankImplementation/getRanking folder.
